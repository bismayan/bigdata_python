# Introduction to Deep Learning for Image Recognition

This notebook accompanies the *Introduction to Deep Learning for Image Recognition* workshop to explain the core concepts of deep learning with emphasis on classifying images as the application. `Python` data stack is used for the workshop. 
 
## Overview

The following topics are covered

1. What is deep learning?
2. Motivation: Some use cases 
3. Building blocks of Neural Networks (Neuron, Activation Function, Backpropagation Algorithm)
4. Introduction to the problem : MNIST dataset
5. Building neural network from scratch
6. Introduction to `keras`
7. Multi-layer perceptron
8. Convolutional Neural Network

Depending on time, the following topics might be covered

1. Using `tensorflow` as backend for `keras`
2. Unsupervised learning using Autoencoders

 
## Installation Instructions

Please refer to the [installation](installation.md) instructions document. That document also has instructions on how to run a script to check if the required packages are installed.
